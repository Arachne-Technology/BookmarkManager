## Key Technical Decisions

### Database Design
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database for bookmark metadata
- **Redis**: Fast caching and job queue storage
- **UUID Primary Keys**: Better for distributed systems
- **JSONB Fields**: Flexible metadata storage
- **Soft Deletes**: Maintain data integrity

### AI Provider Architecture
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable AI provider implementations
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic provider instantiation
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-provider request throttling
- **Cost Tracking**: Token counting and pricing models
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful degradation when providers fail

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-Based**: Reusable React components
- **State Management**: React Query for server state
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript for basic features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
